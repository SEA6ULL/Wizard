[COLORdeepskyblue][B]Welcome to the SEA6ULL Wizard.[/B][/COLOR]

All builds require Kodi 21.0 or greater.

No content is hosted or provided. Trakt and Debrid accounts required. 

Builds will not function properly until credentials have been authorized.

Navigate to the options menu and authorize in each add-on.

Youtube (for trailers) is currently working, but will crash on the initial install.
Re-open Kodi and follow the configuration wizard.

Thank you for flying with SEA6ULL!
